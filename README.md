# 🧠 AI Code Explainer using Generative AI

This project is an AI-powered web application that explains code snippets in plain English. It is designed to help beginners and programmers understand complex programming logic using natural language explanations powered by OpenAI’s GPT models.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Explains Python and JavaScript code
- ✅ Clean and simple UI with Streamlit
- ✅ Supports common constructs: loops, functions, conditionals, etc.
- ✅ Handles invalid/incomplete code gracefully
- ✅ Fast and context-aware responses using GPT-4

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python)
- **Backend**: OpenAI GPT-4 via API
- **Languages Supported**: Python, JavaScript
- **Other Tools**: `streamlit`, `openai`, `dotenv`

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-code-explainer.git
cd ai-code-explainer
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Add your OpenAI API Key in a `.env` file:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

4. Run the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🖥️ Example

**Input:**
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

**Output Explanation:**
> This loop runs from 0 to 4 and prints each number. It uses the `range()` function and a `for` loop in Python.
